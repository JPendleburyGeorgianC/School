                <p>Skyline dripping into the night,
                    like ocean water muddied by the darkest of dyes.
                    So sick of this city's disguise,
                    it's glowing on the surface but it's drowning in LIES!
                    Is there a reason that I feel unalive,
                    when I look back on the home where I grew up and died.
                    Is there a reason that I'm wanting to hide,
                    when I look into the mirror just to see empty eyes.
                    Ah,
                    Ghost town's so loud,
                    can't hear a sound.
                    If I fell from this place,
                    would the world keep on turning as if nothing had changed?
                    G-G-G-Ghost that tried living a tired life.
                    I'm haunted by the memories I buried inside.
                    Upside down falling into the night,
                    will you tell me when I wake up if I'm dead or alive.
                    The world tonight is just too cold.
                    I'm shaken with fear of letting go.
                    G-G-G-Ghost that tried living a tired life,
                    just cover up your ears and sing it into the night.
                    Upside down falling into the light.
                    Will you tell me when I wake up,
                    was I ever alive?
